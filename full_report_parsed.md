a. ADS listed at: NYSE

b. Ratio of ADS to equity shares: One ADS for one equity share

c. ADS symbol: INFY

d. The American Depositary Shares issued under the ADS program of the company were listed on the NASDAQ National Market in the US on March 11, 1999. We had withdrawn the listing of our ADSs from NASDAQ and listed the same in the New York Stock Exchange. With effect from December 12, 2012, we transferred the listing of our ADSs from the NASDAQ to NYSE. Also, the Company began trading of its ADSs on NYSE Euronext’s (NYX) London and Paris markets on February 20, 2013. The Company’s shares were delisted from Euronext Paris and Euronext London effective July 5, 2018 primarily due to the low average daily trading volume of Infosys ADSs on Euronext Paris and Euronext London, which is not commensurate with the related administrative requirements.
